Honey and lemon Tea recipe

Ingredients:
	
	1 teaspoon of Honey
	1 Lemon
	1 cup of Hot water

Method:
	
	Put the kettle on and boil some water. Squeeze the lemon juice and put in a cup.
	Add the honey to the cup. Then add the hot water to the cup and stir. If you've 
	got a sore throat it's best to allow the water to cool down a bit before adding
	it to the cup as boiling water kills off the healing properties of honey or 
	something.
